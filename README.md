# Music_Library
OOSoftware Engineering class project

# Original Discussion Board Project
I chose to adapt the project idea posted by Christopher Thompson, who wrote:
“My last Python project was a simple CLI Application to store and search for books I have read before. I implemented the ability to store books with a rating, change book ratings, and search for books.”

# My Adaptation
Instead of storing books, I am building a Java Music Library Indexer that scans my ripped CD collection and creates a searchable database of artists, albums, and tracks.
This project is inspired by the same core idea as the book-tracking application, but adapted to handle a large real-world dataset. I recently ripped hundreds of CDs from my personal collection into a structured folder system, and I want a program that can automatically organize and analyze the collection.

# Notes
Could use SQLLite, or just write a flat .txt or .csv file to draw from
